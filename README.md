## What is JobTrackr?

JobTrackr is a web application that lets you keep track of all your job applications in one place. Instead of managing multiple Excel files or sticky notes, you can organize applications by status, analyze your resume against job descriptions using AI, and generate cover letters automatically.

The application is currently hosted on free tier services, which means the backend may take 30 to 60 seconds to wake up on the first request. This is normal and expected behavior for free hosting services.
